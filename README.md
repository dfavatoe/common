# Landing Page – React + Vite + Tailwind

This project is a static landing page built with **React**, **TypeScript**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**.

It was initially prototyped using Base44 and later migrated to a fully independent codebase for customization, deployment, and maintenance.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- **React** (frontend UI)
- **TypeScript** (type safety)
- **Vite** (build tool & dev server)
- **Tailwind CSS** (utility-first styling)
- **Framer Motion** (animations)
- **Lucide React** (icons)

This is a **frontend-only** project (no backend).
